# Image Orientation Detection using CNN and CIFAR-10 Dataset
This is a Machine Learning project for image classification. I classified images as 0 degree orientated and 180 degree orientated based on there orientation level. I used CIFAR-10 dataset, over 30,000 images used as train set.

The code is written in Google Colabrotary and I used Google Drive as file location system. I used Keras libraries for Convolutional Neural Network.

#### Confusing classes when the image is Original/Reversed.
